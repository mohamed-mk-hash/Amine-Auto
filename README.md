An e-commerce website for selling cars, built using pure PHP, MySQL, and HTML (no frameworks). Includes an admin dashboard to manage car listings, categories, promotions, delivery options, and orders. The client side lets users browse cars, add to wishlist, use the contact form to inquire about vehicles, and subscribe to the newsletter. No online payment â€” all transactions handled offline.
